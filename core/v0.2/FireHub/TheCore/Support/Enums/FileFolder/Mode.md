# Cases

<h2><a name="read"># READ</a></h2>

```php

### ### Open for reading only

_Place the file pointer at the beginning of the file.

### ### Open for writing only.

_Place the file pointer at the beginning of the file and truncate the file to zero length.
If the file does not exist, attempt to create it.

### ### Open for writing only

_Place the file pointer at the end of the file.
If the file does not exist, attempt to create it.
In this mode, fseek() has no effect, writes are always appended.

```

### ### Open for reading and writing

_Place the file pointer at the end of the file.
If the file does not exist, attempt to create it.
In this mode, fseek() only affects the reading position, writes are always appended.

<h2><a name="create_write"># CREATE_WRITE</a></h2>
***

```php
\FireHub\TheCore\Support\Enums\FileFolder\Mode::CREATE_WRITE = 'x'
```

### ### Create and open for writing only

_Place the file pointer at the beginning of the file.
If the file already exists, the fopen() call will fail by returning false and generating an error of level E_WARNING.
If the file does not exist, attempt to create it.
This is equivalent to specifying O_EXCL|O_CREAT flags for the underlying open(2) system call.

<h2><a name="check_write"># CHECK_WRITE</a></h2>
***

```php
\FireHub\TheCore\Support\Enums\FileFolder\Mode::CHECK_WRITE = 'c'
```

### Open the file for writing only

_If the file does not exist, it is created.
If it exists, it is neither truncated (as opposed to &amp;#039;w&amp;#039;), nor the call to this function fails (as is the case with &amp;#039;x&amp;#039;).
The file pointer is positioned on the beginning of the file.
This may be useful if it&amp;#039;s desired to get an advisory lock (see flock()) before attempting to modify the file, as using &amp;#039;w&amp;#039; could truncate the file before the lock was obtained (if truncation is desired, ftruncate() can be used after the lock is requested).
